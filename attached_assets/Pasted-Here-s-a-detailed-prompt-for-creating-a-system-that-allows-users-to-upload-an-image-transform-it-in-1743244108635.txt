### **Prompt: Build a Ghibli Art Transformation Tool**

**Requirements:**

1. **Image Upload Functionality:**
   - Allow users to upload images in common formats like JPG, PNG, or GIF.
   - Ensure the uploaded image meets size and resolution limits (e.g., under 2MB and 4000x4000px) to avoid performance issues[1][2].
   - Validate file types and sizes during upload to prevent errors.

2. **Studio Ghibli Art Transformation:**
   - Integrate an AI-based image transformation tool capable of converting images into Studio Ghibli-style art.
   - Options include:
     - Using tools like FlexClip, Getimg.ai, or MidJourney for seamless Ghibli-style transformations[3][4][8].
     - Provide customization options where users can refine the style or intensity of the transformation.

3. **Image Download Feature:**
   - Enable users to download the transformed image in their preferred format (e.g., JPG or PNG).
   - Include a visible "Download" button after the transformation process is complete[5][6][9].

4. **User Interface:**
   - Create a user-friendly interface with clear instructions:
     - Step 1: Upload an image.
     - Step 2: Click "Transform" to apply the Ghibli style.
     - Step 3: Preview the result and download it.
   - Add progress indicators during upload and transformation processes.

5. **Backend Workflow:**
   - Use secure APIs for image uploads and transformations (e.g., Cloudflare’s Direct Creator Upload for secure handling)[2].
   - Store temporary files securely and delete them after processing to maintain privacy.

6. **Optional Features:**
   - Allow users to share their Ghibli-style images directly on social media platforms.
   - Provide basic editing tools (e.g., cropping or adjusting colors) before or after transformation[8].

**Implementation Tools and Frameworks:**
- Frontend: React, Vue.js, or any modern JavaScript framework for responsive UI.
- Backend: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or similar frameworks for handling uploads and API calls.
- AI Integration: Use APIs from platforms like Getimg.ai, DeepAI, or FlexClip for Ghibli-style transformations[3][8].
- File Storage: Use cloud storage services like AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2 for temporary file handling.

**Outcome:**  
A web-based tool where users can upload an image, transform it into a Studio Ghibli-inspired artwork using AI, and download the result effortlessly.
